NEON-utilities
================

<!-- ****** Description ****** -->


NEON-utilities is a repository hosting packages and code for basic data handling for NEON data. It currently contains:

1. `neonUtilities`: an R package for discovering, downloading, and working with NEON data files. This builds upon the deprecated pacakge, `neonDataStackR`.
2. `neon-data-stacker-python`: a Python script for combining the monthly files delivered by the NEON data portal into a single file for each table type. This script is a prototype version and not for general use. It is being **deprecated** in favor of using the `neonUtilities` R package within Python. Please see the Notebook in the neon-data-stacker-python directory or use the NEON Science <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/neon-utilities-python"> Using NEON Utilities in Python tutorial</a> to learn more.
